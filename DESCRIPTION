Description: Provides a function (make_focal_matrix) to create matrices of 
  circular or sector neighbourhoods for use with the `focal` function (package 
  `terra`). Also includes utility functions for some common tasks with compass
  bearings such as converting bearings to and from Cartesian angles and 
  determining the direction and angle of shortest rotation between two bearings.
